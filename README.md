# Bitmap Wire Logic Simulator

A simple and visual bitmap simulation of a real 8-bit microprocessor to explain the very low-level principles of operation (lower than assembler).

## The Rules

### Rule 1: directly connected cells are the same wire
### Rule 2: the intersection of wires through a not-a-wire is a wire crossing
### Rule 3: the special pattern (including rotations) is a NOT gate
